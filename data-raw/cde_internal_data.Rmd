## cde internal data

For the purpose of constructing API calls, `cde` makes calls to an internal datadrame (`ea_wbids`) which consists of a table of the details (name and index number for each site/catchment) of all waterbodies that can be downloaded from [https://environment.data.gov.uk/catchment-planning/](https://environment.data.gov.uk/catchment-planning/). The file here (`ea_wbids.csv`) contains a copy of the internal data content. The data are provided under the terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0 (https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).
