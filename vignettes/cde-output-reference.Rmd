## Reference list of all output columns

The table below gives information on all the current columns of data retrieved by the different functions of `cde`; names, what they mean and which functions return them. The EA do modify the format of their data from time to time, so this will be updated as necessary.


Column name | Description | Output by which functions
--- | --- | ---
river_basin_district | Name of the River Basin District. This is the top level in the [catchment hierarchy](https://environment.data.gov.uk/catchment-planning/help#help-catchment-hierarchy). | All functions
management_catchment | Management Catchments are the next level down the hierarchy, see link above. | All functions
operational_catchment | Operational Catchments are the next level down from Management Catchments. | All functions
waterbody_id | Water Bodies are the smallest unit in the catchment hierarchy, representing all or part of a river system, lake, estuary etc. Each has a unique ID (WBID). | All functions
status | WFD status classification (High, Good, Moderate, Poor or Bad). For objectives this represents the target (aimed for) status class. | All get_ functions except get_pa
classification_level | The level within the range of classification elements that the status class refers to (NEEDS LINK) | objectives, rnag & status
cycle | Which cycle of assessment the data come from. The first cycle. The first cycle ran from 2009 to 2015 and cycle 2 to 2015-2021. There were changes in some environmental standards between cycles and for theoverlap period, `cde` only returns cycle 2 assessments.  | -
water_body | Name of the waterbody. | rnag etc.
