cde TO DO
----------
Need to revise tests - fails on size of returned df - change in source data

Revise max year (2016 data now available) - can this be set from actual data?

Change colour scheme to allow viridis option (hard code to avoid dependencies?) - set as default?

Check layout of legend to avoid overlap

Allow specification of colours in plotting functions

Add function to get other data (beyond classification) - more detail on elements, measures etc.
